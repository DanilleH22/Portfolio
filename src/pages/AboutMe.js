    Hi, I’m Danille, a software developer with a unique background in psychology and a passion for building intuitive, user-centered digital solutions. After earning my degree in Psychology, I developed a deep interest in how technology can enhance human experiences. This curiosity led me to pursue a diploma in Software Development, where I gained hands-on experience in modern programming languages and development frameworks.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    As I transition into a full-time career in software development, I’m focused on creating applications that are both functional and empathetic to users' needs. My psychological insights give me a unique perspective on user experience and behavior, allowing me to design software that is not only efficient but also mindful of how people interact with technology.
    <br/>
    <br/>
    I’m excited to combine my skills in problem-solving, critical thinking, and software development to tackle challenges in tech, and I’m always eager to learn and grow in this ever-evolving field.
